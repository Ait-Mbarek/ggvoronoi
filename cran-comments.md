New submission

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Heatmaps (4:29)
  Voronoi (4:8, 10:48)

## Justification
From what I have researched, I can't fix this NOTE since it is the first submission.
The possibly mis-spelled word "Voronoi" is a proper noun and "Heatmaps" has been used in other CRAN packages.
